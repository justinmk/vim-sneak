                    Sneak - the missing motion for Vim

==============================================================================
OVERVIEW                                                               *sneak*

Sneak provides a way to move quickly and precisely to locations that would be
awkward to reach with built-in Vim motions.

To use Sneak, type "s" followed by exactly two characters:

    s{char}{char}

Thus you can often reach a target with 3 keystrokes. Sneak always moves
immediately to the first {char}{char} match. Additional matches are
highlighted, you can reach them by pressing ; (just like |f| and |t|).

Above all, the goal is to get out of your way. See |sneak-usage| for
a quick-start, and |sneak-features| for full description.

Sneak works with Vim 7.2+ (|sneak-label-mode| requires Vim 7.3+).

USAGE                                                            *sneak-usage*

Example (cursor position indicated with brackets []): >
    [L]orem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit
<
Type ssi to go to the beginning of the word "sit": >
    Lorem ipsum dolor [s]it amet, consectetur adipisicing elit
<
Type ; (or s again, if |sneak-clever-s| is enabled) to go to the next match: >
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipi[s]icing elit
<
Type Sdo to go backwards to the beginning of the word "dolor": >
    Lorem ipsum [d]olor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit
<
Type dzad to delete from the cursor to the first instance of "ad": >
    Lorem ipsum [a]dipisicing elit

CUSTOM MAPPINGS                                        *sneak-custom-mappings*

Sneak provides <Plug> keys for you to specify alternative mappings. But
keep in mind that motion mappings should be the least-friction mappings in
your editor, because motion is the most common editor task.

Available <Plug> keys: >

    " 2-character Sneak (default)
    nmap ? <Plug>Sneak_s
    nmap ? <Plug>Sneak_S
    " visual-mode

FEATURES                                                      *sneak-features*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NORMAL-MODE

`s` (and `S`) waits for two characters, then immediately moves to the next
(previous) match. Additional matches are highlighted until the cursor is
moved. Works across multiple lines.

If a |language-mapping| is activated, Sneak waits for keymapped sequences as
needed and searches for the keymapped result as expected. (Requires Vim 7.3+)
'keymap' 'iminsert' |mbyte-keymap|

[count]s enters |sneak-vertical-scope| mode.

`;` and `,` repeat the last `s` and `S`. They also work correctly with `f` and `t`
(unless you or another plugin have mapped `f` or `t` to a custom mapping).
[count]; and [count], skip to the [count]th match, similar to the
behavior of [count]f and [count]t.

    Note: If your mapleader is |,| then Sneak maps |\| instead of |,|.
    You can override this by specifying some other mapping, e.g.: >
        map gS <Plug>Sneak_,
<
                                                              *sneak-clever-s*
Similar to clever-f[3], immediately after invoking Sneak you can move to the
next match by hitting `s` (or `S`) again. If you instead move the cursor or do
something else, then `s` starts a new Sneak. In that case, you can repeat the
most recent Sneak search by pressing "s<Enter>" (or whatever key, if any, you
mapped to <Plug>Sneak_;). To enable "clever s": >
    let g:sneak#s_next = 1
<
Sneak adds to the |jumplist| only on the initial invocation; so after moving
around with ; and , (or s/S) you can easily go back via |CTRL-O| or |``|.
    - Repeat invocations (;/,) do not add to the jumplist.
    - Consecutive invocations ("s" immediately after s/S/;/,)
      do not add to the jumplist.

s<Enter> ("s" followed by Enter) always repeats the last search, even if |;|
and |,| were reset by |f| or |t|. This is especially useful for re-invoking
|sneak-label-mode| (because |;| and |,| never invoke label-mode).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VISUAL-MODE

`s` works in visual mode the same as normal mode, however to search backwards
use `Z` (because `S` is taken by the |surround| plugin). `;` and `,` also
work in visual mode as they do in normal mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPERATIONS

Use `z` for operations (or map to something else: |sneak-custom-mappings|).
For example, `dzab` deletes from the cursor to the next instance of "ab".
`dZab` deletes backwards to the previous instance. `czab` `cZab` `yzab` and
`yZab` also work as expected.

Repeat the operation with dot: |.|
Note: Requires repeat.vim https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERTICAL SCOPE                                          *sneak-vertical-scope*

Sneak has a unique feature called "vertical scope" search. This is invoked by
prefixing `s` or `S` with a [count]. Then the search is limited to a column of
width of 2×[count]. Vertical-scope never invokes |sneak-label-mode|.

Use-cases:
    - CSV file
    - man page (example: search for "-e" in `man bash`)
    - hex editing :%!xxd
    - any columnar layout

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LABEL-MODE                              *sneak-label-mode* *sneak-streak-mode*

Label-mode minimizes the steps to jump to a location, using a clever interface
similar to vim-easymotion (but Sneak is faster and more predictable than
vim-easymotion).

To enable label-mode:                                         *g:sneak#label*
>
    let g:sneak#label = 1

Sneak enters label-mode if there are ≥2 visible (on-screen) matches. To force
label-mode always (instead of passively letting Sneak decide), set a mapping
to <Plug>SneakLabel_s. Example: >
    nmap s <Plug>SneakLabel_s
    nmap S <Plug>SneakLabel_S
<
<Tab> skips to the next set of matches (<BS> or <S-Tab> go the other way).
These actions are preserved when repeating!

<Space> or <Esc> exits label-mode. |g:sneak#label_esc|

|folds| are skipped (not labeled). (Use |;| and |,| to reach folded or
off-screen matches.)

Compared to vim-easymotion:
- Never modifies your data. vim-easymotion uses edit-and-undo hacks.
- Never adds extra "stages" or "groups", so it is predictable. The _common_
  case is the highest priority.
- Target labels are always visually separated.
                                                           *sneak-fallthrough*
- Non-label keys "fall through" to normal-mode, so you don't need to
  explicitly exit label-mode if the first match is correct.

As always, you can:
- Skip to the next or previous match with |;| or |,|
- Return to your original location via |CTRL-O| or |``|
- Use any |operator|, including |surround|.
- Repeat operations with |.| (dot).

Note: If `s` is prefixed with a [count] then |sneak-vertical-scope| is
invoked.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                            *sneak-configuration*

Sneak is designed with sane, effective defaults, to avoid configuration as
much as possible; but you can change them as follows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONS                                                        *sneak-options*

To change an option, add a |let| statement in your |vimrc|. Example: >
    let g:sneak#use_ic_scs = 0
<
g:sneak#f_reset = 1
g:sneak#t_reset = 1

    Note: Defaults to 0 if you mapped f (or t) to any |sneak-mappings|.

    0 : Pressing |f| (or |t|) will NOT clear the last Sneak search. So you could
        define different maps for <Plug>Sneak_; or <Plug>Sneak_, and still
        use ; and , for |f| and |t| as usual.

    1 : Pressing |f| (or |t|) causes Sneak to "reset" so that |;| and |,| will apply
        to the last f (or t) motion instead of the last s or S. This makes it
        possible to use ; and , for all three motions (f, t, and s).

        Note: if f (or t) was already mapped by you or a plugin, Sneak will
        not override the existing mapping unless you explicitly set f_reset
        (or t_reset). This means Sneak will not be able to reset ; or , when
        you invoke f or t. See the README.md FAQ regarding "f-enhancement"
        plugins.

g:sneak#s_next = 0

    0 : Disable |sneak-clever-s|.

    1 : Enable |sneak-clever-s|. It works like this: immediately after
        invoking Sneak, press "s" _again_ to go to the next match, or "S" for
        the previous match. This behavior persists until you move the cursor.
        Note: You can still use |;| and |,| as usual.

g:sneak#absolute_dir = 0

    0 : Relative direction. |;| goes to the next match in the direction of the
        initial s/S invocation and |,| goes in the opposite direction.

    1 : Absolute direction. Repeat via |;| or |,| always goes forwards or
        backwards respectively.
        Note: With |sneak-clever-s|, s and S behave the same as |;| and |,|.

g:sneak#use_ic_scs = 0

    0 : Always case-sensitive

    1 : Case sensitivity is determined by 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase'.

g:sneak#map_netrw = 1

    0 : Don't do any special handling of "file manager" buffers (such as
        |netrw| or filebeagle).

    1 : Set up Sneak mappings (s and S) in "file manager" buffers (|:Ex|,
        |:Vex|, filebeagle) and replace the default buffer-local s and
        S mappings with <leader>s and <leader>S.

g:sneak#label = 0

    0 : Disable |sneak-label-mode|.

    1 : Enable |sneak-label-mode| if the Vim |+conceal| feature is available.

                                                           *g:sneak#label_esc*
g:sneak#label_esc = "\<Space>"

    Exit |sneak-label-mode| as if <Esc> were pressed.
        https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak/issues/122

g:sneak#target_labels = ";sftunq/SFGHLTUNRMQZ?0"

    List of characters used to label the target locations. |sneak-label-mode|

    Labels should be keys that you never use after searching. E.g. it is
    unlikely that you will use "F" immediately after a Sneak, so "F" is in the
    label list. This removes a step if the first match is correct: instead,
    just type your next command. |sneak-fallthrough|

    Note: Any key mapped to <Plug>Sneak_; is moved to the first position
    (because it's semantically equivalent).

    Note: Invalid target labels are removed:
        - Any key mapped to <Plug>Sneak_,
        - Special keys: <Esc> <Tab> <BS>
        - Invisible keys: <Space> <Enter>

g:sneak#prompt = '>'

        Message displayed at the Sneak input prompt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGHLIGHTING                                                 *sneak-highlight*

Sneak uses these highlight groups:

    Sneak
        Highlights Sneak matches. Default color is hideous magenta :)
        Also used for |sneak-label-mode| unless "SneakLabel" group exists.

    SneakScope
        Highlights the "scope" for |sneak-vertical-scope|.
        Default color is white (or black if 'background' is "light").

    SneakLabel
        Highlights |sneak-label-mode|.

To customize Sneak colors, handle the |ColorScheme| event: >
    autocmd ColorScheme * hi Sneak guifg=black guibg=red ctermfg=black ctermbg=red
    autocmd ColorScheme * hi SneakScope guifg=red guibg=yellow ctermfg=red ctermbg=yellow

To disable Sneak highlighting, link it to the "Normal" highlight group: >
    autocmd ColorScheme * hi! link Sneak Normal

To disable Sneak highlighting but NOT |sneak-label-mode| highlighting: >
    autocmd ColorScheme * hi! link Sneak Normal
    autocmd ColorScheme * hi SneakLabel guifg=white guibg=magenta ctermfg=white ctermbg=magenta

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS                                                    *sneak-functions*

These functions are provided if you want more control.

sneak#wrap(op, inputlen, reverse, inclusive, label)             *sneak#wrap()*
        Sneaks with exactly {inputlen} characters. E.g. if {inputlen} is 2 the
        match is performed when the second character is pressed, without
        waiting for <Enter>.
        {op} may be blank "" or any operation (even custom operations).

        Example: Configure "f" to trigger label-mode: >
          nnoremap <silent> f :<C-U>call sneak#wrap('',           1, 0, 1, 1)<CR>
          nnoremap <silent> F :<C-U>call sneak#wrap('',           1, 1, 1, 1)<CR>
          xnoremap <silent> f :<C-U>call sneak#wrap(visualmode(), 1, 0, 1, 1)<CR>
          xnoremap <silent> F :<C-U>call sneak#wrap(visualmode(), 1, 1, 1, 1)<CR>
          onoremap <silent> f :<C-U>call sneak#wrap(v:operator,   1, 0, 1, 1)<CR>
          onoremap <silent> F :<C-U>call sneak#wrap(v:operator,   1, 1, 1, 1)<CR>
<
        Example: Configure "s" to wait for 3 characters: >
          nnoremap <silent> s :<C-U>call sneak#wrap('',           3, 0, 2, 1)<CR>
          nnoremap <silent> S :<C-U>call sneak#wrap('',           3, 1, 2, 1)<CR>
          xnoremap <silent> s :<C-U>call sneak#wrap(visualmode(), 3, 0, 2, 1)<CR>
          xnoremap <silent> S :<C-U>call sneak#wrap(visualmode(), 3, 1, 2, 1)<CR>
          onoremap <silent> s :<C-U>call sneak#wrap(v:operator,   3, 0, 2, 1)<CR>
          onoremap <silent> S :<C-U>call sneak#wrap(v:operator,   3, 1, 2, 1)<CR>

sneak#is_sneaking()                                       *sneak#is_sneaking()*
        Returns 1 if Sneak is active, else 0. Sneak deactivates when the user
        chooses a target or moves the cursor. Useful for changing the behavior
        of a mapping.

        Example: <Tab> goes to the next match _only_ while Sneak is active: >
            nmap <expr> <Tab> sneak#is_sneaking() ? '<Plug>Sneak_;' : '<Tab>'
<
        Example: change the statusline: >
            set statusline=%{sneak#is_sneaking()?'SNEAKING':'RELAXING'}
<
            https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak/pull/93

sneak#cancel()                                                 *sneak#cancel()*
        Deactivates Sneak: removes autocmds/highlighting and causes
        |sneak#is_sneaking()| to return 0.
            https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak/issues/106

sneak#reset(key)                                                *sneak#reset()*
        Prevents Sneak from hijacking |;| and |,| until the next invocation of
        Sneak. This is useful if you have remapped the Vim built-in |f| or
        |t| to another key and you still want to use |;| and |,| for both Sneak
        and your custom "f" mapping.
            https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak/issues/114

        For example, to use "a" as your "f":
>
            nnoremap <expr> a sneak#reset('f')
            nnoremap <expr> A sneak#reset('F')
            xnoremap <expr> a sneak#reset('f')
            xnoremap <expr> A sneak#reset('F')
            onoremap <expr> a sneak#reset('f')
            onoremap <expr> A sneak#reset('F')
<
            Note: The <expr> modifier is required!

sneak#state()                                                   *sneak#state()*
        Returns a read-only dictionary representing the current behavior.

        Values set at invocation (_not_ for repeat):
            KEY             VALUE~
            bounds          [left, right] integer pair representing the current

                            1: invoked as backward motion `S`
            rst             0: |;| and |,| should repeat the most recent Sneak
                            1: after calling |sneak#reset()|
