                    Sneak - the missing motion for Vim

==============================================================================
1. Overview                                                            *sneak*

Sneak provides a way to move quickly and precisely to locations that would 
be awkward to reach with built-in Vim motions. 

Sneak is invoked with s (sneak forward) or S (sneak backwards), followed by
exactly two characters:

    s{char}{char}

Thus, you can often reach a target with only 3 keystrokes. Sneak always moves 
immediately to the first {char}{char} match. Additional matches are
highlighted, and you can reach them by pressing ; (similar to the built-in 
behavior for |f| and |t|).

Sneak has a few other features, but above all, Sneak tries to get out of your
way: highlights and autocmds are removed as soon as the cursor is moved.

Sneak is tested on 7.2+. Vi-compatible mode must be disabled. |'nocompatible'|

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                         *sneak-usage*

Sneak is invoked by one of the provided mappings. |sneak-defaults|
You can change these mappings. |sneak-mappings|

Examples (cursor position indicated with brackets []): >

    [L]orem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit
<
Type ssi to go to the beginning of the word "sit": >

    Lorem ipsum dolor [s]it amet, consectetur adipisicing elit
<
Type ; to go to the next match: >

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipi[s]icing elit
<
Type Sdo to go backwards to the beginning of the word "dolor": >

    Lorem ipsum [d]olor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit
<
Type dzad to delete from the cursor to the first instance of "ad": >

    Lorem ipsum [a]dipisicing elit

3. Features                                                   *sneak-features*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Normal Mode

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Visual Mode

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Text Object (for use with an |operator|)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 Vertical Scope                                      *sneak-vertical-scope*

==============================================================================
4. Configuration                                         *sneak-configuration*

Sneak is designed with sane, effective defaults, so that you (hopefully) don't
need to configure anything; but you can override the defaults in your |vimrc|
file using the following settings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Options                                                    *sneak-options*

g:sneak#options.nextprev_f = 1
g:sneak#options.nextprev_t = 1

    0 : Pressing |f| (or |t|) will NOT clear the last Sneak search. So you could
        define different maps for <Plug>SneakNext or <Plug>SneakPrevious and
        still use ; and , for |f| and |t| as usual.

    1 : Pressing |f| (or |t|) will causing ; and , to apply to that motion instead
        of the last s or S. This allows you to use ; and , for all three
        motions.

g:sneak#options.textobject_z = 1

    0 : Disables "operator" support, so Sneak will not map {operator}z

    1 : Enables "operator" support, so operations like dzab, dZab, 
        czab, cZab, yzab, and yZab invoke Sneak.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Custom Highlighting                                      *sneak-highlight*

Sneak uses two highlight groups:

    SneakPluginTarget

      Highlights additional matches.
      Default color is hideous magenta :)

    SneakPluginScope

      Highlights the search "scope" for |sneak-vertical-scope|.
      Default color is white (or black if background=light)

There are three ways to override the default colors (listed in order of
decreasing elegance):

    1. Link to existing highlight groups (for example, "ErrorMsg" and
       "Comment") so that the colors are implicitly chosen by your
       currently-activated colorscheme: >

       hi link SneakPluginTarget ErrorMsg
       hi link SneakPluginScope  Comment
<
    2. To define specific colors _regardless_ of the current colorscheme, you
       probably need to define an |autocmd| on the |ColorScheme| event: >

       augroup SneakPluginColors
           autocmd!
           autocmd ColorScheme * hi SneakPluginTarget guifg=black guibg=red ctermfg=black ctermbg=red
           autocmd ColorScheme * hi SneakPluginScope  guifg=black guibg=yellow ctermfg=black ctermbg=yellow
       augroup END
<
       |autocmd| is necessary because otherwise your colorscheme will
       (probably) clear the highlights when it kicks in.

    3. Edit your color scheme directly: >

       hi SneakPluginTarget guifg=black guibg=red ctermfg=black ctermbg=red
       hi SneakPluginScope  guifg=black guibg=yellow ctermfg=black ctermbg=yellow
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 Custom Mappings                                           *sneak-mappings*

You can remap any Sneak feature (except the "text object" mappings) by 
defining one or more of these <Plug> mappings in your |vimrc|. Replace ? with 
the key sequence that you want to map to each respective feature: >

      nmap ? <Plug>SneakForward
      nmap ? <Plug>SneakBackward
      nmap ? <Plug>SneakNext
      nmap ? <Plug>SneakPrevious
      xmap ? <Plug>VSneakForward
      xmap ? <Plug>VSneakBackward
      xmap ? <Plug>VSneakNext
      xmap ? <Plug>VSneakPrevious
<

6. Credits                                                     *sneak-credits*

Sneak was inspired by vim-seek and vim-easymotion.

Tim Pope's plugin sources were used for reference and best practices.

easymotion.txt was used for the initial version of this document.
