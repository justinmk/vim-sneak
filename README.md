# Modifications in this fork

Improved sneak streak coloring.
- Text is shaded towards direction of streak.
  - New highlight group is called `SneakStreakShade`
- Exposed option to toggle whether syntax is cleared on sneak streak
  - `let sneak#streak_clear_syntax = 0`
  - Default value of `1` to preserve behavior (could change this)

### Visualization

# sneak.vim :shoe:

Sneak is a minimalist, versatile Vim *motion* plugin that jumps to any location specified by two characters.
It works with **multiple lines**, **operators** (including **repeat** `.`
and **[surround]**), **[keymaps]**, **visual mode**, **[unicode]** ("multibyte"),
and **macros**. Many details have been carefully balanced to minimize
friction between *intent* and *action*.

The plugin chooses sane defaults, easily changed via `<Plug>` mappings
(see [`:help sneak`](doc/sneak.txt)).

**New Option:** Use Sneak as a minimalist alternative
to [EasyMotion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion):

    let g:sneak#streak = 1

[unicode]: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/mbyte.html#UTF-8
[keymaps]: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/mbyte.html#mbyte-keymap
[surround]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround
[count]: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/intro.html#[count]

### Usage (Default)

<a href="http://imgur.com/Jke0mIJ" title="Click to see a short demo"><img src="https://raw.github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak/fluff/assets/readme_diagram.png"></a>

Sneak is invoked with `s` followed by exactly two characters:

    s{char}{char}

* Press `sab` to **move the cursor** immediately to the next instance of the text "ab".
    * Additional matches, if any, are highlighted until the cursor is moved.
* Press `;` to go to the next match (or `s` again, if `s_next` is enabled; see [`:help sneak`](doc/sneak.txt)).
* Press `3;` to skip to the third match from the current position.
* Press `ctrl-o` or ``` `` ``` to go back to the starting point.
    * This is a built-in Vim motion; Sneak adds to Vim's [jumplist](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#jumplist)
      *only* on `s` invocation—not repeats—so you can 
      abandon a trail of `;` or `,` by a single `ctrl-o` or ``` `` ```.
* Press `s<Enter>` at any time to repeat the last Sneak-search.
* Press `S` to search backwards.

Sneak can be **scoped** to a column of width 2×[number] by prefixing `s`
with a number.

* Press `5sxy` to go immediately to the next instance of "xy" within 5 columns
  of the cursor.
    * A highlight block indicates the vertical scope.

Sneak is invoked with [**operators**](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#operator)
via `z` (because `s` is taken by surround.vim).

* Press `3dzqt` to delete up to the *third* instance of "qt".
    * Press `.` to repeat the `3dzqt` operation.
    * Press `2.` to repeat twice.
    * Press `d;` to delete up to the next match.
    * Press `4d;` to delete up to the *fourth* next match.
* Press `ysz))]` to surround in brackets up to `))`.
    * Press `;` to go to the next `))`.
* Press `gUz\}` to upper-case the text from the cursor until the next instance
  of the literal text `\}`
    * Press `.` to repeat the `gUz\}` operation.

### Motivation

    l  f  t  %  'm  }  ]m  ]]  M  L     /
                                     ^
                                     |
                                   sneak

Vim's built-in motions cover many special cases, but it's awkward to move across 
several lines to an arbitrary position: `f` is restricted to the current line,
and `/` is [clunky](#faq) for medium-distance motion.

Compare Sneak to Vim's built-in `/` and other plugins:

  - minimum of **3 keystrokes**
  - repeat motion via `;` and `,`
  - repeat operation via `.`
  - move anywhere, even offscreen
  - jump immediately to first match
  - only the *initial* invocation adds to the jumplist
  - preserves default behavior of `f t F T ; ,`
  - avoids noise in `/` history
  - [count] prefix invokes *vertical scope*
  - always literal: `s\*` jumps to the literal `\*`
  - supports [mbyte-keymaps](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/mbyte.html#mbyte-keymap)
    ([#47](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak/issues/47))

### Installation

- Manual installation:
  - Copy the files to your `.vim` directory (`_vimfiles` on Windows).
- [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
  - `cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone git://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak.git`
- [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
  1. Add `Plugin 'justinmk/vim-sneak'` to .vimrc
  2. Run `:PluginInstall`
- [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
  1. Add `NeoBundle 'justinmk/vim-sneak'` to .vimrc
  2. Run `:NeoBundleInstall`
- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  1. Add `Plug 'justinmk/vim-sneak'` to .vimrc
  2. Run `:PlugInstall`

If you want to repeat Sneak *operations* (like `dzab`) with dot `.`,
then [repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) is required.

### FAQ

#### Why not use `/`?

For the same reason that Vim has [motions](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#left-right-motions)
like `f` and `t`: common operations should use as few keystrokes as possible.

* `/ab<cr>` requires 33% more keystrokes than `sab`
* Sneak remembers *only* the initial position in the Vim jumplist—so you can explore a trail of matches via `;`, then return to the start with a single `ctrl-o` or ``` `` ```
* Sneak doesn't clutter your search history
* Sneak is always literal (no need to escape special characters)
* Sneak has smarter, subtler highlighting
* Sneak *Streak-Mode*

#### Why not use `f`?

* Sneak is *fifty times* more precise than `f` or `t`
* Sneak moves vertically
* Sneak highlights matches in the direction of your search

#### How dare you remap `s`?

You can specify any mapping for Sneak (see [`:help sneak`](doc/sneak.txt)).
By the way: `cl` is equivalent to `s`, and `cc` is equivalent to `S`.

#### How can I replace `f` with Sneak?

```
    nmap f <Plug>Sneak_s
    nmap F <Plug>Sneak_S
    xmap f <Plug>Sneak_s
    xmap F <Plug>Sneak_S
    omap f <Plug>Sneak_s
    omap F <Plug>Sneak_S
```

#### How can I replace `f` and/or `t` with *one-character* Sneak?

Sneak provides `<Plug>` convenience-mappings for `f` and `t` 1-character-sneak.
These mappings do *not* invoke streak-mode, even if you have it enabled.
```
    "replace 'f' with 1-char Sneak
    nmap f <Plug>Sneak_f
    nmap F <Plug>Sneak_F
    xmap f <Plug>Sneak_f
    xmap F <Plug>Sneak_F
    omap f <Plug>Sneak_f
    omap F <Plug>Sneak_F
    "replace 't' with 1-char Sneak
    nmap t <Plug>Sneak_t
    nmap T <Plug>Sneak_T
    xmap t <Plug>Sneak_t
    xmap T <Plug>Sneak_T
    omap t <Plug>Sneak_t
    omap T <Plug>Sneak_T
```

#### I want to use an "f-enhancement" plugin simultaneously with Sneak

Sneak is intended to replace the so-called [f-enhancement plugins](#related).
You can use both, but Sneak won't be able to hook into `f`, which means
`;` and `,` will always repeat the last Sneak.

### Bugs

Sneak tries to be well-behaved and annoyance-free. If you find a bug,
please report it, and perhaps include the output of:

    :call sneak#debug#report()

Sneak is tested on a 10-MB, 400k-lines, syntax-highlighted file with 
Vim 7.2.330, 7.3, 7.4.
